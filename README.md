### Contact Book â€” C++ Data Structures Project

## A console-based contact management system written in C++ that utilizes linked lists, vectors, and basic sorting/searching algorithms. This project was created as part of a Data Structures course assignment and demonstrates fundamental concepts like linked list manipulation, selection sort, binary search, and basic input validation.

### Features
--Add, edit, delete, and search for contacts

--Store multiple phone numbers per contact

--Organize contacts into 26 linked lists (one per alphabet letter)

--Validate phone number inputs (numeric only)

--Sort names alphabetically using Selection Sort

--Search names using Binary Search

--View number of contacts under each letter

--View all stored contacts
---
### Data Structures Used
--Linked List: To store and manage contacts efficiently under each alphabet letter

--Vector<string>: To keep a sorted list of names for binary search

--Structs: To define contact and Node entities
